Double End Spotweld Cutters to be very aggressive. The first one bit in, snapped one of the four teeth right off. I have no clue what broke it.

The initial aggressiveness has worn off.

For the money... I have found better spot weld bits and will most likely not reorder these as they definitely don't last as I expected. Sorry, but facts are facts. I'm not that impressed. As I mentioned in the review under ""Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutter in Blister Pack"", the bits were extremely difficult to remove remove from the #13216 Arbor/Retractable Pilot threaded shaft. I had to resort to putting the arbor into a vice, clamping it down, TIGHT, and removing the bit with a pair of vice grips. The threads are common right handed threads so there should be no doubt one would remove the bit in a left handed motion. Every time I removed a bit, same thing. This is caused by the right handed direction the bit turns when removing spot welds. Understandable, but they really become torqued in place.

Sorry for the negative review, but Facts are Facts! When they cut, they cut. But why make this kind of work more difficult than it needs to be. At the cost??? Well, I'll let you be the judge.",Sep

Well if you look below and see Sony's response.... what a lame reply.
I like how the comment is just ""sorry"".....  why wouldn't the organization try to make it right?
Your smart response would have been to say ""email me and I will send you a lens cap"".
Or "" here is what you can buy on Amazon that fits"".
Hey Sony.... now you really blew it....now everyone can see how stinky your ""after purchase"" customer service is.... sheesh, what a joke.
And you can be sure I will share this story with everyone I can......

Original Review:
Well I have had this camera for 1.5 years and have to say it takes amazing pictures.
It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brands and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere.
Fits well into small bags, purses etc

Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one.....
There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... has been a nightmare...... sigh!!
I wasted tons of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size.
Tried a few camera stores and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded....
That means I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap.
What a ""post-purchase"" drag this has been!
Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brands now that have more main stream camera parts so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle......
You've lost all my future business on this Sony.....",Aug

But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.

I also bought a fancy jig system, then realized this adhesive is the only thing I need. I lined the inside of a cabinet, fastened a dummy door pull to the closet, and added a 3/4 inch piece of wood to the bottom of a door in less than ten minutes. Very fast and very strong!
  As suggested by another reviewer, I remove the tube after squeezing out an inch of adhesive and capping it. I store the tubes in the freezer in a vacuum sealed jar. Oh, and customer service by Franklin international is awesome.

Edit: After a using it for over a year, I am more aware of the limitations at home and in my beginners woodshop. It did not replace the pocket screws or the dowelmax, but complements them. It is unbelievable when I have 2 clean surfaces to be joined with enough flat surface area to hold. These are critical factors to remember.

The short set time for the 30 and 75 glues, though, means I have to get things aligned perfectly and very quickly--which as a novice woodworker is almost never! I just assembled a downdraft sanding box trying the 300 (5 min set time) which worked better for me on this kind of project. A more skilled person would use it for even more things. the biggest advantage is not having to wait overnight for the glue to set before moving on with a project. You are supposed to wait 24 hours before ""stressing"" it but it is strong enough to sand or whatever within 15 minutes.

 I just used a tube of the 75 (partially used) and a new tube of the 300 that had been stored in my freezer and almost 1 1/2 years past the expiration date. Very good product IMO.",Not churned

It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy.",Jun

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.

I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next.",Oct

They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative.

These things are flashlights or devices that I - a retired electronics engineer don't see how they can build at this price point much less how good and solid they really are and how well they actually work.
Under no circumstances would I mount one on a Picatinny Rail Mount (even if it fit), or other life/death applications but - me I just need a flashlight. A good one that can save me from replacing expensive lantern batteries which this thing does superbly. The only problem is it's so darn small it gets lost real easy. if you can actually count that as a problem....",Not churned

Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for.

Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt.

  Shipping was very prompt, only two days. The headlamp comes in a nifty leather pouch, another first for a headlamp. And the batteries provided are Duracell Copper Top. Not some cheap off brand batteries, often provided in new flashlights.
  In the purchase of my last Vitchelo head lamp, I wasn't sure how water, and weather proof this product achieves. I'm happy to say; the Vtchelo
V 600 exceeded my expectations in keeping out all water. My Vitchelo V600 is also very rugged. After 6 months of being strapped to my hard hat, as I work on all sorts of cranes. My V600 has taken many hard bumps; I've onIy replaced the batteries twice, and my quality head lamp keeps working and working. I'm very impressed with the Vitchelo product line. I know this same standard of quality will carry over into my Vitchelo V600 Plus.

Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",Jul

If I were Bose, I would be ashamed to put my name on it as the factory speakers suck so badly. I replaced the sub with a Kicker and amp and the front door speakers with a pair of Infinity reference 6032cf's I got from Amazon. I went with these as they are 2 ohm just as the system speakers are.

These speakers are incredible! With the sub dialed in to my base level preference the sound system now sounds like it should have with the name BOSE on it.

These speakers are not meant to be a replacement base speaker, however they do an admirable job with it. The two position (0db - 3db)tweeter is phenomenal and the mids are so clear! Since I'm not trying to explode my kidneys or rock the car next to me with too much volume, I am more than pleased with Infinity.

A word of caution here... the Infinity site says that the rear door speakers for the first generation CTS are 6.5""... Do NOT believe it. the rears are 5.25""... I had to return one set 6.5's and I'm waiting for the 5.25's to arrive so I can finish the install.

Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.",Not churned

I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

The good side; if you don't want all the fancy bells and whistles and just feel like browsing the web and checking your email, this will be perfect for you. If you have a Gmail account, you'll love it even more with the way it integrates your account with everything made by Google.

I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.

This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.",Not churned

What started me on it was talking to someone one day about how they would drink a tablespoon of it daily for a chronic heartburn issue. Well, that is all I had to hear to try it. Next time I went shopping I bought some with the mother in it. I am one of the crazy sorts that enjoy it straight up. LOL. However, I do add it to water most days. I can't imagine not having it on hand so when I was offered this, I figured it would be great to try since I've only used Bragg's in the past.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I have not found what I feel to be the 'mother' in either bottle. There is some sediment but I haven't found the mother. I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo.

My only issue is the manual, and it's probably not the manufacturer's fault.  It's the lawyers.  With this litigious society we live in, you can no longer get a manual that tells you what to do and how to do it.  It's always a long laundry list of warnings and cautions.  Due to this, it's nearly impossible to search through the manual on how to actually do something, because that useful tidbit was wedged between the warning about using the saw on a fluorescent tubes and the caution against hand-holding it to cut down tree branches.

I'm pretty sure that if all the lawyer-speak was removed, the instructions would fit on a single sheet of paper.

I've discovered that if I set the blade bevel at 45 degrees, if I were to actually turn it on and bring the blade down, it would shred the aqua-colored plastic table inserts at the center of the cutting surface.  I've spent a long time searching through the manual about this.  Is there another adjustment?  Do these inserts need to be removed before cutting a bevel?

I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

I ordered these to put them in my camper as ambiance lighting under the edge of the bed and couches and boy are they much more! I am going to be putting these around the slide out edges and more. Have to order more. I love you can cut them to length you want.

I figured they would be fair to moderately bright and maybe be able to be changed from white to colors. I had no idea that they were programmable, had presets you can make, the controls are more than robust, they are amazing! As you can see in the video and photos these things can be made to shine brighter or dimmer, and any color combination you can think of or of course the solid colors of Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. The ability to change the settings are endless and was fun to play with.
What I like is these are bright enough to be used to illuminate a work bench or a working area, and also as decorative lighting like I am going to use them for.
These LED lights are more than I had hoped for and are amazing for the price. They are on a strip which you can cut to length and is adhesive backed. I will be using some extra strength double sided tape to help hold it in place.

If you need LED strip lighting for indoor use, this is definitely something you can use and able to do more than people think! My son wants some now for his room to put up.

I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them...

I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.

A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around.

Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with.",Sep

My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

1) It does use quite a bit of space. To keep the arms from extending beyond the back of my desk (which was important in my particular setting), I had to mount it (drill the hole) almost 12"" in from the back edge of the desk. That places the monitors about 15"" in from the back edge of the desk.
2) Cord management is minimal. The upper of the arms, the cords are simply ""tied under"". The lower of the arms, the cords are held inside by the most complex piece of molded plastic known to man, which must be carefully inserted by a Plastics-Certified Brain Surgeon. I am surprised that they didn't think to allow the cord management to share a hole with the support itself, which would have been handy.
3) It says ""amazon basics"" on a prominent logo right in the middle of the base. I don't need more logos on my stuff, unless you're going to pay me handsomely to display them. (This will work to cover the logo: https://smile.amazon.com/Scotch-Duct-Black-1-88-Inch-60-Yard/dp/B0013AX6FC/)

Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped.
now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.

When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.

Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.

Do not hesitate - grab one of these units now before they realize it should be priced higher!!",Not churned

What I like best is how it's totally stable yet has a very small footprint. The flat base is heavy and totally sturdy and only about a third of an inch thick. Since other objects on your desk or bedside table can sit on the flat base or the base can slip under other things, it effectively takes up almost no space. I got one of these for my bedside table four or five years ago and like it so much I just bought two more. The small ""handle"" (short bar) attached to the head is the only thing about it that strikes me as potentially at all flimsy, and it's not really necessary. I can adjust the angle of the neck easily with one hand. Most of the time the 25watt is plenty bright and I don't need 50watt very often. I'd prefer a switch I can push on-and-off on the lamp itself to the wheel switch that's attached partway down the power cord, but it's not a big deal. A switch on the base or the arm would require them to be thicker and spoil the simple design, so I keep the five stars. I got this lamp after I was disappointed with several cheaper (potentially dangerous) halogen desk lamps bought at local stores and swore I'd never buy a cheap one again. You can find halogen desk lamps that are a lot cheaper and you can find ones that are a lot more expensive, but I haven't seen one yet that's a better value for the price.",Not churned

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it.
I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable.
As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc.
5 second delay to get the mouse recognized.
Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect.
At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver.
The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button.
Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.

Biggest pro:
The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it.

Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like.",Not churned

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up.

It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection.

Mag Light's rechargeables aren't as bright and SureFire's are much more expensive, so the UltraStringer is really made for someone desiring a quality light that won't break the bank.
Some of the nice features of this light: It's very lightweight, very bright (75,000 candlepower), run time is very good for this much light output.  Well made, quality construction.
Some of the cons about this light:  Plastic lens (seems only SureFire will give you a genuine Pyrex, glass lens these days) and the spot/flood range isn't really that much of a difference (Mag's spot/flood produces a SPOT or a FLOOD).  The Streamlight has a very coarse adjustment range, really being all the same style output, with very LITTLE difference in the SPOT / FLOOD.  This isn't as bad as it sounds as the light produced is a very good, pure white light, I'd just like to see more variation in the range, but I'm being picky here.
One thing's for certain; this light is much better than Mag's rechargeable and a lesser light than SureFire's 8 or 9N rechargeable.  But, it's also half the price of the SureFire and 80% less than SureFire's 10-X.  So, I've got to give it 5 stars for being a great value, occupying a market not really served by either Mag or SureFire.

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

The drive itself works mostly as expected (about 12% slower than its specs).  But the installation was arduous and can be expensive.

First, the drive is formatted for Windows and all the software provided is Windows only.  So you need to use Disk Manager to erase the disk, rename it to something meaningful, and reformat it to Mac OS Extended Journaled.  Then you need a piece of software like Carbon Copy Cloner to mirror your existing hard disk onto the new SSD.  CCC is a great software package, which you should probably own anyway for various backup tasks, but if you don't already have it, buying it adds to the expense of the upgrade.

The provided installation guide is a pamphlet of 8 pictures for installing on a desktop, 6 pictures for installing on a laptop, and 1 frame of cautions.  All very generic and useless for my MacBook Pro.  By the way, both sets of pictures show a SATA-to-USB adapter cable for cloning, which was not included and must be purchased separately.

The installation requires a 7mm to 9.5mm space adapter for 2.5 drives.  Again this is an additional purchase as the Samsung SSD is more shallow than the original drive.  The actual physical installation involves removing the cover, removing the drive clamp and old drive, removing the 4 stud screws on the old drive and putting them onto the SSD, applying the spacer (be sure to orient the drive to the cable connector before adhering it), seating the drive (it still seemed a little loose), re-installing the drive clamp and replacing the cover.  The studs are required on the new drive to make sure it seats into the clamp.  Why Samsung couldn't spend an extra $.0005 and include these on the SSD is unknown.

So, overall 4 stars for the drive, 0 stars for the lack of Mac installation support and the required accessory expenses, averaging out to 2 stars for this review.",Sep

It's a battery-operated setup and remarkably easy to install with double-backed tape.

In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.

My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.

So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush",Not churned

The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.",Not churned

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.

Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.

Cuts are not clean, I have to use a file to clean them up and smooth the edges. Were I a professional, this would have been unacceptable, but since I am not, I can live with it (for a while, till perfectionism gets the best of me).
In the past I've used one much more expensive aluminum-cutting blade. We're talking close to $100, and smaller diameter (between 7"" and 8"" -can't remember exactly). Now, THAT blade...

I have an LG 60LB6300 60-Inch TV and at the very least you can remove this from the box, sit it on the entertainment center below the TV, plug it and the sub in and that's it. With my TV I can send the audio wirelessly which worked well, but I chose the optical cable instead. Even with the optical cable the sound bar turns on and off automatically without exception. The sub syncs by itself, and Bluetooth worked great but I only used it when I first opened the box to hear the sound from this bar. One thing I noticed is it was recommended for 43"" and smaller tvs. This may be due to length, however I mounted it in the center of the TV with the included wall mount, and if centered properly it looks perfect. It is pretty loud as well, we usually have the volume between 15 and 25 out of 100.  I have the sub turned down and in a corner behind my couch (it just needs a wall outlet) and also sounds good.  The bar itself adjusts with the TV volume which displays on the TV when adjusted. Basically I never have to touch the sound bar or use it's remote (which is a good thing cause I haven't seen it in a month).

In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.

In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change.",Sep

I received it with the thermal glue already dried up, so I used GE silicone II to mount the extra heatsinks. If you do this, make sure the heatsink stays in place for at least a full day and let the stuff cure before using the card.

In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.",Not churned

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.",Aug

If you have been looking for a pair of the best ear plugs in the world, you're in luck. This ear plug is made in China.

I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the price that's going to scare the heck out of me. I'm sure you can't beat it for the price.

I used it to replace a pair of ear plugs in my home that were broken in the house. The new plugs were already out of service.

I was worried about the price and the hassle of replacing the plugs, but it's not that. I bought these plugs because I wanted to keep a pair of them in my family room.

I had a pair of these ear plugs that I used for my first pair of ear plugs. The first pair was on sale for $11.00 each. I thought it was good, but the second pair was $6.00 each. I went through the process of replacing the pair of plugs and would not return them.

I was told to wait for the new plugs to come out. I did not have to wait.

I have a pair of these ear plugs that I use for my first pair of ear plugs. They were installed in a room that is covered with carpet. The carpet was dark. The floor is exposed to the light. The ceiling is exposed to the light. The light is not on. I put them in the middle of",Jul

They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.

I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.

Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.

I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.

So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.

I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)",Not churned

These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.

I only had one surprise with the DeWalt and that was that the clutch functions only on the high speed setting.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

Don't let the quirky design lure you in. Look to more basic type tile saws.",Oct

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3.",Not churned

I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.

11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.

When I finally ran out (who thinks about buying roller covers from Amazon) and couldn't find more at my local hardware store or home center, I bought others made by Purdy, Shur-Line and other well-known brands. None were ever as good as these. Purdy makes excellent paint brushes, but their rollers are merely OK and tend to make bubbles. Shur-Line makes excellent edgers but I never used any of their covers that didn't shed. Even Shur-Line's most expensive, top of the line ""premium select"" roller covers with their ""shed resistant technology"" shed badly. It's not the paint - I only buy Benjamin Moore and it's about $65 a gallon these days. They even tolerate cleaning well, if you want to you can get two or three uses out of a cover, but at this price why bother?

So after failing to find anything better, I bought another set of these Wooster covers from Amazon. Once again I am pleased. They hold paint well, don't leave bubbles, and absolutely do not shed. They're better than ones I've paid three times as much for.",Not churned

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.  I know that AIO's also run the potential of leaking,  but I feel that your chances are much lower.  Good luck everyone.

The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine.

It really does have a bad over, but I was spoiled by leather in the past. No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it.

Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous. I love how it incorporates the E-Luminator (sold separately). It's quite a slick design. I love that I can store the E-Luminator right in the case.  I also love the strap that keeps the book securely closed or open.  It folds back on itself like a dream, and is very comfortable to hold either open or folded back. The inside has a nice microfiber suede-like lining that offers protection against scratches.

It's a great case.. really great, if you don't mind the plastic cover.  I am hoping that they will offer leather versions in the future, and more color choices.",Apr

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

Our large single bowl sink caused the two to be mounted at opposite sides at the rear of the sink--20"" apart center to center. I soon discovered that the spout grounding wire and the LED spout indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance.

I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.",Not churned

Dollar for dollar I do not know of a higher value than this line of meters. If you want a better one but still high value you can look for some of the Uni-t brand meters for ~$20. One caveat with these, what I call ""Harbor Freight"" meters, is that half of the meter leads are trash. You MUST test the leads. I run 1A through the lead and test the voltage across it with a known good meter. If a lead measures more than .2V at 1A it is unusable. I have seen these leads test as high as .6V at 1A. That is .6 ohm. Many of your readings will be meaningless with leads with that kind of resistance. As for the units themselves, they work quite well. I've only had one fail. The display was quite jumpy for some time. Then the readings started to drift very high before the display just went blank. I avoided these cheap meters for years because I did not think I could get a respectable product for this price, but now this is my go-to meter for when I might leave it behind or lend it out and not get it back.

After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright. I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

The original ads looked promising, but they have just one problem: little of this will work for you. The main problem of this kit is that you're very unlikely to force it doing anything useful.

THE GOOD
-Sensors and the hub look better than many other plastic junk boxes out there.
-The customer support works great. +1 star for that.
-Bundled ""things"" are very easy to connect.
-It sometimes works.

THE BAD
-The app has a decent look, but a terrible design: it's very confusing and often feels stupid.
-To make things worse the app will prompt you to buy extra stuff without being able to run a single scenario.
-Scenarios (here they're called apps) are both useless and confusing. Just need to pair a motion sensor and light? Good luck finding an easy way to do that.
-Sonos and Philips HUE support works. Only in beta. And only if you consider such (mis)behavior a ""work"".
-Bundled manual refers to the old version of the app. But who cares if it's useless anyway?

THE UGLY
-I've spent nearly 40 minutes trying to connect the hub to the app. I'm neither mentally limited nor twisted handed, but the whole process is so confusing that I'm not sure I'll be able to repeat it again.
-Good luck making the basic kit doing anything more useful than sending you an SMS when someone opens the door.

The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

I am currently trying to contact the Sporting Goods place that sells these through Amazon to try to resolve. Turns out I got them here on Amazon, and the ones I got are very cheaply made, very poor manufacturing and you can't reach the company that makes them, so I would not recommend.

This little gizmo will convert a GU10 bulb to fit one of those regular fixture sockets. And it does it well! The GU10 bulb has two connector prongs (it's called ""bayonet base"") to connect to the power source, these posts being quite similar to the connectors of old fluorescent ""starters"" in days of yore. But, alas, you may very well be a bit too young to remember those.

I do not know why bulbs with this type of bayonet connector are priced less than the screw-in type, but with using these adapters, your purchases of the GU10 bulbs will be less (usually) than buying bulbs with the regular type base. You'll add about an inch overall to the height (or would that be length) of what the GU10 bulb would be if it were affixed into a bayonet base style socket. But for the most part GU10 bulbs are much shorter than their regular base counterparts - so not a prob.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.",Not churned

This one was ok, but not as nice as the G7 Power G7GU10300WW for the same price. Please consider trying the G7 bulb and read my review of it.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable.

Toddler seat is stable. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the seat is very flat. There is no rise or ""horn"" in the front. When you have a newly potty trained toddler, they don't always understand leaning forward or making sure their privates are right over the hole, especially when they are trying to balance on top of a tall toilet. This problem applies to both a boy (especially) and a girl. If you have a squirmy toddler, the chances of peeing onto the top of the toilet seat is pretty high. My recommendation to the company is to add a contoured toddler seat.

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

I was confident in this when I got this showerhead because I have other Grohe fixtures in my home, and they are awesome. So, I have every confidence in the quality of this fixture.

My problem with it is that while it says ""retro-fit,"" which would seem to indicate that it can be retrofitted to just about any shower out there, assuming that the shower has enough room to fit the unit, which mine did. The problem (for me, anyway) is that the fixture is so heavy, it needs to be anchored into the wall with huge screws both on the top of the unit and the bottom. So, you have to have the structure inside the wall of your shower in order to have something to anchor those screws into. I happen to have an older home, and while my shower was re-done recently, (not by me), the structural integrity just isn't there. Luckily, the plumber I hired to put this unit in, realized this before he got too far into it.

So, the bottom line is that, again, while this is a ""retro-fit"" showerhead, it will not work for every shower, and you need to be very careful to know whether or not your shower can work with this unit...not just in terms of size, but in terms of structural integrity inside the walls...before you buy it.

I was unable to install this unit, but I'm still giving this a four star rating. Why? Just based on my previous experience with Grohe products...knowing how great the quality is with this company. I also thoroughly inspected all the parts of this when the plumber opened the package, and all parts for this are heavy, well made, and high-quality.

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.",Not churned

The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.

When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.

I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.

PROS:
The price is great.
The cable is well made and thick
Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.

CONS:
I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly...
(Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)

Side note:
Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable.",Not churned

A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.

1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home.

Overall, this light is a great value for the price. I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a nice light that will last a long time.I used this to replace the old glass door to get the new one I had.  I was using the old one and I had",Sep

I chose this one because it has a separate switch for the red light.  I am an amateur astronomer, and I use a red light when I am observing to protect my night vision when reading star maps and eyepiece focal lengths.  It takes about 30 mins for your eyes to become dark-adapted, and thus able to see very faint deep sky objects.  A flash of white light ruins night vision for another 20-30 mins, and my previous headlamp had to cycle through 3 white light settings just to get to red, and this was a nuisance to me and anyone who was observing with me.  THIS headlamp allows me to switch on the red light without any possibility of turning on the white light, and I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for my wife.
Enough about red light, now I'll tell you what I like about the white light.  I had to do some work in the attic, and I used this headlamp to see what I was doing in the dark attic.  It starts of with the brightest white light setting at first one when you press the white light switch.  If you quickly press the switch again it goes to a dimmer setting for longer battery life if you're going to have it on for an extended period.  There are 3 brightness levels which can be accessed by pressing the switch again within about 5 seconds.  I am very pleased to tell you that you don't have to cycle through all these brightness levels to turn it off, because after being on in any brightness mode for more than 5 seconds results in it simply switching off with ONE press of the switch.  All this and a LIFETIME WARRANTY for an incredibly low price.  Stop looking now and buy this one -- you won't be disappointed.",Not churned

I bought a package of 6 bulbs for $7.90,  installed them and was so impressed with the quality and brightness, I went back and bought four more packages to give to friends and relatives.  These are high-quality bulbs.

They FEEL sturdy. I like LED bulbs that have the ceramic ""band"" around the bottom.  They're less fragile and I have cats!  The metal base is solidly connected to the bulb and it screws in to the socket with a tight connection.  They come on instantly with no flickering.  The light streams from the bulbs in all directions so that you get full coverage.

And they're BRIGHT. I was hesitant to buy them because the package is marked ""warm white.""  I prefer ""daylight"" or ""natural light"" bulbs because they give off more light.  I don't want ""ambiance.""  I just want to be able to see where I'm going.  However, these produce a strong, natural looking light with very little yellow in it. They're supposed to be 60W-equivalent, but the brightness is similar to 75W-equivalent LED bulbs.

Because they're so reasonably priced, I felt that I could use them to replace the CFL bulbs in my basement and the difference is incredible. The four ceiling fixtures in my basement have uncovered bulbs, so I appreciate the sturdiness of the Feit bulbs.

I bought these locally and on sale, but the regular price of under $20 for a package of six bulbs is very reasonable, given the quality of the bulbs.  If you want strong light (especially in a place where the bulb may be bumped into) I think these are an excellent choice.",Not churned

I have an HTPC with Windows Media Center that has built in Hauppauge tuners (one PCI single, 1500 series I think, and a dual PCIEx1 2250 model).  I was thinking that eventually, I'd be able to not be stuck with routing coax cables to the computer, and be able to access the tuner content over the network.  It worked pretty well for about 10 months.

The first one didn't work and after a hassle-free Amazon return, the second one broke after about 10 months.  The cooling fan stopped working and it was so hot to the touch, it was making my closet smell like burnt electronics.  I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire (not sure if it is UL listed or not.)  And like most warranties, you have to send it to the manufacturer and pay the shipping.  Yawn.  I guess I could have bought a new one and send the old one back, but that is somewhat unethical, and I didn't want to risk a house fire anyway, so at this point, I don't think you could pay me to take one.

The cooling fan in this unit is very loud, so it would need to be tucked away and not in the main viewing area.

On the other hand the Hauppauge tuners have performed flawlessly for probably about 5 years.  As a bonus, the Hauppauge also acts as my IR input to my computer which enables easy integration with Evenghost for automation with my Harmony remotes.  As a con, it seems the Hauppauge dual tuner has the worst signal, the single has slightly better, and the HDHomeRun had the best.  So if Hauppauge could better manage the ATSC signal in the tuner, there would be a clear winner there.  But even so, low heat, no noise, and flawless operation over 5 years is a large upside.

Bottom line, I will not purchase or consider this unit again.",Jun

I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.

If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.

I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.

We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.

So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.

I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.

I guess that a good deal of torque is applied to the single nut and bolt holding it in place, and it loosens easily, at least when installed without Locktite as my plumber did.  It's almost impossible to get at this nut.  I could feel it in order to hand-tighten it blindly, but I couldn't get it secured.  I thought getting a wrench on it without a special plumber's faucet tool would be impossible.  I was therefore nearly ready to give up and request a service call, that surely would have cost $100, when I saw this product.  It came in 2 days, and my faucet was secured rigidly (pun intended, sorry) in 2.01 days -- a minor miracle from my desperate perspective.
I wish it had multiple inserts for different size nuts because if they're mounted flush, I don't see how it could reach the smaller sizes, as designed with the smaller-sized wrenches nested within and below the largest.  That didn't matter in my case, but it would limit the usefulness somewhat under some circumstances.
Other reviews would lead one to believe that it's too flimsy to be useful, and that's certainly UNtrue.  The construction is plenty strong enough for hand-tightening or loosening, which is all it's designed for and which should almost always be sufficient.  I can see how you might crack or break it if you tried to turn the lower end with a pipe wrench.  The slot, which is the genius-inspired part of this tool, could allow it to deform under that kind of torque, but it's not designed for that use.

I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer.

Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.

The touch display and menu navigation are quite user friendly.  It took me a while to figure out the best settings, though. One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route.  The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major arteries and highways that you'll most likely want to use and remember.  Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen settings to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.

But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems.",Not churned

I'm a professional electrical guy and have always had an interest in the design of solid and flexible electrical devices. After a lot of research, I decided to give this a try. The Starrett is very compact and gives you the ability to hang your electrical devices on the wall, which is great for storing them in your pocket. The magnetic element has a very good feel to it and the design allows you to hang your device on the wall to protect it from the elements. The black felt pad is also very well made and the holder is super heavy and sturdy. The handle is very secure and the included charger is included. The charger is very easy to use and I don't have to worry about batteries. It's also a very nice feature that you can put the charger on the wall with one hand. You can also put it on the floor and hold it on the floor for a longer time. The charger has a very nice feel and is very well made.

The price was right and I'm very happy with it. I have used it on a number of projects and I'm very happy with the quality and performance of the product. The product is very well made and it is well made. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to hang your electrical devices on the wall.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.",Not churned

Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.",Jul

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.

I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.

This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.

The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.

With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.

The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.

I highly suggest this box to anyone that has tools and wants to keep them organized in one spot. There is a lot of room in this box and they made it the right size for things like long sockets to stand up next to eahother insted of stacking them ontop of eachother.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

In sum, a fine product that does exactly what I want.",Not churned

The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

I only needed a couple of shelves for the limited space and buying a full sheet of Slatwall was prohibitively expensive and would delay the project.

Technically, this cuts a T-slot that's a bit larger than true Slatwall, but it works.

I ran the melamine shelf board through my table saw with the blade raised to just under the depth of the cutter's eventual depth. Then I moved the fence over and cut it again to create a 1/4"" dado. This removed a good deal of material so the cutter didn't have to work so hard.

I then used my router table and its rip fence to create the T-slot. Cut some scrap first to assure the proper depth. Worked like a charm.

A 2'x4' piece of Slatwall goes for $58. This $18 cutter and some scrap 3/4"" melamine did the trick and I can use the cutter again for a long time. And I have no unusable leftover Slatwall pieces. Nor did I have to wait for the Slatwall to be delivered. (It's not stocked locally.)

I already had some Slatwall 6"" shelf brackets I got at Amazon at for a previous project.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KC-Store-Fixtures-A01724-Slatwall-Shelf-Bracket-6-34-Black-Pack-of-25/dp/B013KA7UI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KC Store Fixtures A01724 Slatwall Shelf Bracket, 6"", Black (Pack of 25)</a>

As you can see, you must purchase 25 of them at a time. I had already used 20 of them in my pantry so the five leftovers went to this project. Perfect.

I cut some 9/16"" thick shelves from some old 1x12s I had salvaged from an old project and planed them down from 3/4"", then sprayed some water-based MinWax Polycrylic on them for protection.

Obviously, this cutter is only economical if you already have the other tools. But it's a great economical addition to my router bit collection.",Not churned

In the driveway an infrared type light makes sense, but on the front lights using this timer in the automated setting is best.

Installation:
I fist use a contactless voltmeter to find the Hot Wire (has 120v current)  hooked up to the light switch and mark it with nail polish. Then go turn off your circuit breaker. Next go an connect the BLACK wire to the one which you just marked with nail polish. You will need to find your neutral, which is generally white and NOT connected to a standard two pole light switch. Just find the neutral and some white 14 gauge solid white wire and create a pig tail; then connect it to the white wire with an electric wing nut. Lastly, connect the blue LOAD wire to the wire which was connected to your switch. Sometimes you might have a green wire which was a ground wire. I just loop it around the screw as I reinstall all the wires. I also tend to wrap everything in electric tape as I go to ensure no shorts anywhere.

Go to google maps and get your current location, you will need the first two numbers of your Lattitude and Longitude.  Press the big frond button for 3 seconds to enter configuration mode and follow the single directions. It's mostly updating the year, month and day, next the time and lastly the latitude and longitude. Lastly I don't like the back light on all the time, so I turn that off. It still glows for 8 seconds whenever you press any button. I use the defaul P01 which turn on at sunrise and off at 11pm in your time zone and automatically adjusts for day light savings time.

Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.

The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

First, I want to say I own two older models (WDBAAN0000NBK) for several years and love it. My only negative is I am unable to configure them to indicate newly added content (not sure if this is doable).

Last year I tried a refurb version of the WDBYMN0000NBK-HESN and more recently purchased and returned a brand new unit. Both times I experience similar problems. Frequent glitches such as freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS devices simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issues with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI as it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional.

I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.

I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these.

It's like going from an 8-track to a CD - yep, there is that much of a difference. I am now a Gummy convert and will only use these. I have purchased an extra pair and I keep them well hidden. Bottom Line: These are fantastic ear buds, especially for the price. The incredible sound these provide make walking the dogs a true joy - allowing me to disappear into a cloud of loud, clear music, piped comfortably into the hearing holes on each side of my head. and keeps out the interruptions caused by a bunch of extraneous noise.

The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that ""DR"" in an address means ""Drive"" and not ""Doctor"".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.

Previously  I had a plumber retrofit all the stop/shutoff valves to the new quarter stop valves. This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on.

Mine had the Quick-Change adapter with 7 hex shank high-speed drill bits.  The drill bits are of excellent quality as is the click adapter.  All you have to do to insert a bit is push it in.  To remove it simply pull back on the padded collar of the adapter and the bit pops out.  Unlike Sears, Dewalt, Snapy and other quick adapters that I have used you do not have to pull back on the adapter and pull the bit out at the same time. The Bosch just pops it out.  What impressed me the most however was the lack of run out that the Bosh has.  The wobble that is present at the driver bit or drill bit tip that anyone who has ever used any sort of quick change hex shank adapter is much less noticeable with the Bosch than any I have ever used.  I am a solid surface/laminate fabricator and much of my time is spent installing counter tops and kitchen cabinets where a drill is indispensable for drilling as well as driving.

Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.

With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.

A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item.

It totally seals the crack.  Some cracks I have gone back the next year and applied a little more of the sealer to update the sealing of the crack.  It works wonderfully like nothing I have ever seen before and I have owned homes for 49 years.",Not churned

At the moment, I have a single WD 2TB ""Green"" hdd installed.  I like the small footprint, the ease of installation, the web browser interface, and the power savings.  It boots up fast too.  And it's super quiet.

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

This Dlink uses less than 1/10 the power that my old file server used.  It will pay for itself in less than three years.",Not churned

I paid about $120 on sale for this unit and paid nearly $300 for the older nuvi 350.  For starters, the free Lifetime update was very nice.  For my Garmin nuvi 350, I had to purchase the map updates card for about $95.  The screen on this unit is thinner and a little larger.  I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.  I could see where that would be helpful driving in areas like California.  The feature that provides your traveling speed in the lower left is kind of annoying.  I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.

I put the older Garmin nuvi 350 in the kids' car.  Utah commonly has addresses like 348 East 500 North. Addresses are indexed from the center of each town.  Once the teenagers figured out that Garmin just wants the 348 for the address and 500 for the street, which then gives you options to choose 500 North or 500 South, they use it whenever driving to someplace new.",Not churned

The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it.",Dec

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.",Not churned

The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider.",Jul

Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even has it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminals of my recess can which has the gx23 connector and it was 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it.
Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess lights in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wires are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing means cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which has the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it.

I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.

The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the laptop is closed. Typing is harder, you have to press the keys harder and its a matte, somewhat tacky finish on the keyboard cover. This means traveling around the keyboard takes some getting used to. My only gripe is that the MacBook keyboard backlighting is seriously encumbered by this cover. The cover is not transparent where the characters on each key are labeled, meaning the light doesnt shine through. The only light you get is around each key. In a dim or dark area, its no good for seeing the keys.

I like having the cover. I like how super thin it is and the protection it offers. Typing with any keyboard cover requires some getting used to. I really wish the letters and number on each key were illuminated, thats my only complaint.",Not churned

I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more.

The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.",Not churned

The frame has handy features and is easy to use.  One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.

After deciding to move up to an 18 volt product, I spent months conducting research, going to wood shows, and actually trying out numerous lithium ion and non-litium ion 18 volt tools.  My final choice was this kit.  Here are some of the reasons why:

Batteries:  18 volt lithium ion.  Fantastic idea to go with lithium ion.  The charge lasts longer and will not dissipate over time.  In addition, the battery design (outer housing) is smart.  I do not need to click two buttons on the side to disengage the battery from any of the tools.  I simply need to click the one button on the front of the battery and the battery slides out.  Because my hands are small, this makes all the difference in the world.

Drill Driver - For my hands, this was the most ergonomically correct grip I found.  This drill feels great, does not fatigue my hands after many hours of use, and does not weigh as much as the competition.  The 18 volt battery does not add as much weight as I thought it would, and the tool balances in my hand perfectly.  In addition, I didn't think I would like having LED's built into the drill, but I really do like the additional light when I am working.  Excellent drill all around.

Recip Saw - Again, excellent feel and power.  I have used this saw to cut through a variety of materials without any lag.  The one button saw change also adds a nice touch.  Grip and balance are excellent, with the battery adding the perfect amount of counterweight to the entire setup.

I cannot overstate how good this light is. Bonus:  If you have an older SL-series light, this flashlight charges in the same sleeves, so no need to buy all new kit.",Not churned

I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.

It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.

Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.",Jul

First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars.",Jun

The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it was rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of sets of halogen track lights years ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb.

But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other lights and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulbs when it comes to lighting up my room, and it's just as good as one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white walls and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulbs they replaced.

I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.

When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade.

It charges via USB charger (they include both wall and car chargers). The charging port does not have a cover, so I am afraid it will get dirty or wet and it will prove fatal for the light.

The three moving lights can either be folded along the main body of the flashlight, or they can be spread out, but they cannot be brought up more than 90 degrees to the surface and cannot concentrate all four lights on one spot. I found it irritating, especially in tight spaces, where it would be nice to fold one of the sides more to the center to fit in a light corner. The magnet is strong enough to hold the flashlight horizontally, but just barely - it is very easy to knock it down.

The battery life was relatively good so far, and it charges rather fast, too. When the battery gets low, it turns off without any notice. You can turn it on again for a few seconds to find a charger. It does not charge and light up at the same time - if you plug it in and turn on, it will not be charging at all. Empty battery will stay empty battery.

The most irritating thing is that it has one button for multiple modes. When you first turn it on, it only lights up the end, as a regular flashlight. But when you are done, and want to turn it off and press the button, it lights up the three sides, effectively blinding you, unless you unfold the sides and direct them away.

What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.",Aug

This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills!

There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.

Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...

Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else.

The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.

Pro's
 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them
 Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes
 Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go

Con's
 If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out
 Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level
 Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot

In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.",Not churned

Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.",Apr

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.

The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod.

At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price.",Not churned

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right?
So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time?
I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!
 I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it.",Not churned

I have it interconnected with two other KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms and four Kidde/Firex SA320CN Dual-Sensor smoke alarms located throughout the rest of the house. This CO alarm has a 9v battery backup in case of power interruption and will sound along with the other interconnected CO alarms when one of them detects a high CO level. It has its own distinct sound pattern to differentiate it from the sound the smoke alarms make. However, this CO alarm is apparently designed so that it will not also sound the interconnected smoke alarms, which would mean if you only had one of these CO alarms installed in a remote location of your home, like a basement, it may not be able to alert people in other areas of the building when it activates. So, the ideal solution would be to have one of these interconnected CO alarms on each floor in addition to smoke alarms. The alarm has a built in end of life notification feature that alerts you when it needs replacement with two chirps every 30-seconds. The Amazon product description above says this occurs after seven years of operation, but the actual User's Guide that came with it says ten years, so not sure which is correct. Overall, this CO alarm seems decently made and was fairly reasonably priced. Of course I hope to never actually have it activate from high CO levels in our home, but it's good to know it is there just in case.

Update: According to Kidde's website, the KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms manufactured as of 2013 now have a 10-year end of life cycle, not 7-years as indicated in the product description above.",Not churned

Now there are multiple batteries available on Amazon for the DeWalt drill. So, how did I settle on this Pwr+ battery. I spent some time reading the product reviews and ultimately found that this particular aftermarket brand had high ratings and pleased customers that stated the battery not only charged well, but lasted as well.

Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I have used it a couple of times and it seems to be working well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Update:

I was thinking about going with this camera and decided to buy a Canon 2D with a 2D sensor.  I have had several Canon 3D cameras and I just can't get enough of them.  The 2D sensor is perfect for me.  I have had no problems shooting the 3D, I shoot with my Canon, not with the camera.  The Canon 2D is great for the price.  I have not had any issues shooting 3D on this camera.  The only issue I have is the battery life.  I have had a 3D camera for several years now and have had good battery life.  I just wish the 2D was a little longer but I am happy with this camera.

Update:  I am very happy with the purchase.  I have had no problems shooting",Not churned

It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.

I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus.

I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.",Not churned

I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)

Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.

The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made.",Not churned

This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

(Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.",Jul

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT.",Jul

Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

I figure, I am spending this much money, it oughtta be a pretty decent unit. Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!!

Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools.",Not churned

The D1000 doesn't come with an abundance of ports, but it's does the job.  If there were one flaw it might be the ports, but it's hard to fault it with the multiple video outputs, network, audio, and more than enough USB ports.  I tested this with two 24"" displays.  I used multiple computers, including a few different laptops and a Surface Pro 3.  This included Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I had a great experience with all variations.

The dock itself is fairly compact and go on top of your desk or on a shelf or other alternative.

The next day always at a different time than the previous day, when I want to run the distiller for five hours, I have to set the timer again as to what time it should go on and then off and also set the day for it to run and whether it should repeat everyday, every other day etc...all settings that are insignificant to me.

I wish I could just set to run for five hours and have it turn off afterwards. It was a lot of money to pay for for what I needed: a simpler setup. I am sure it is great for turning lights on and off randomly, as it says it does.

I have it plugged in an outlet under a wall cabinet which has a light under it but I have to use a flashlight to view the digital screen. It protrudes beyond where the light can shine on it.

When setting the times, if you go past the number you wanted, you cannot reverse it, but have to go all the way around the 12 hrs to get back to the number you wanted. This goes for hours and minutes, days of the week etc, for each of the on and off settings. Kind of a hassle. Anyone know of a simpler timer?",Jun

About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.",Aug

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent.

Although it might be obvious, don't buy this TV if you are going to be watching it from few feet away. Too close to the TV and regular cable will look fuzzy since the low resolution is magnified to a 58 inch screen. Amazing picture quality with Blu-ray without any optimization. Regular DVD and HD cable have an excellent picture as well. We are viewing it from about 12-14 feet which i think is optimal. No motion blur with action sequences.

There isn't too much glare appreciable even a sunny room in our house. The viewing angles are excellent which is one of the reasons we choose plasma over LCD.

The audio speakers are okay to good but you are better off with a surround sound system if you have it. The TV does have a faint buzzing sound that you can hear if you turn off the volume. It isn't annoying and I believe it goes away as the TV warms up.

Overall, a great TV for a reasonable price ($2099 is the lowest recently offered.) If you are looking for a large plasma, check it out.",Not churned

It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

The lock is a total failure. The iPhone has to have the app open or it doesn't work, the lock locks arbitrarily, often after I use the key to get in and it locks as I'm closing it (sending the bolt into the doorframe)
When it does work the mechanism is so slow that I would never want to be trying to get into the house in a panic situation.
I have calibrated and re-calibrated,  all to no avail.

They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.",Not churned

Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!

One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised.

The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

Purchasing a month ago, both fears were unfounded.

Electronic Express was fine, shipping on Monday after a Friday order via FedEx Ground.  The box was strapped vertically to a pallet and the driver helped removing it from the pallet and using a hydraulic platform to get it to the ground and into the house.  Net result:  no shipping nor delivery problems.  The set worked perfectly upon arrival.

As to the picture and operations, I have it on an HDMI connection from a DirecTV HD satellite connection.  The black level is as astonishing as they advertise and the picture as clean and crisp as I observed earlier (at a Sears where they had this, the Sharp and the Sony side-by-side, with the Samsung as good as the Sony and much better than the Sharp).

We are in Florida, where the sun is known to be particularly bright and this room has huge western sky facing windows.  There is a little sun glare and reflection in the very late afternoon but all parts of the screen are still easily viewable and after a few minutes any annoyance from glare and reflection is tuned out by one's eyes.  In sort, there's no problem here with the issue.

Highly recommended for the price and overall quality.

Addendum (December 2009):  Well, a month after the warranty expired, so did this product.  I had an authorized Samsung repair shop look at it and the LCD drivers had failed.  Great, I thought, a simple circuit board change.  WRONG!  That circuit board was ""married"" to the display so the entire display needed to be replaced.  $1500 plus labor!  Short result:  the Samsung was junked and a reliable Sony replacement purchased.  Star rating reflects the unconscionable cost of repair of a somewhat simple problem.",Oct

The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers.

I picked up a pair of Sony bookshelf speakers at a thrift shop months ago and decided it was time to mount them.  But I wanted a mounting that was simple, cheap, and effective, took a chance on these satellite speaker mounts and found them to be perfect.

The mounts can fit both single screw speakers (like my Sony) and double screw speakers, they can also be set up to be longer (about 5"") or shorter (about 3"") and come with the screws and hardware to mount to the speaker and to the wall (including dry wall anchors)  The mounts also include the Allen wrench necessary to adjust the mounts and permit the speaker to be oriented just about in any direction or attitude.

With the help of my cordless screwdriver, I had both speakers mounted nicely on the wall in about 15 minutes.  (And that includes looking over the included instructions until I realized that one could actually ignore them.)

BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts.",Jun

No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I did a lot of research and at the time this was by far the highest quality and best value at this price point and size. It's not a smart tv but most smart tv's apps are hard to use and poorly implemented besides I have an xbox and chromecast so I don't care about it being a dum TV.

Picture: super bright amazing image quality for the price point this tv will not disappoint! Extremely customizable image settings allow you to adjust the picture just how you want it. A quick google search will yield settings that work well but I had to fiddle with the backlighting and black levels to get it how I thought looked best.

Sound: other reviews say sound sucks on this tv. The sound is actually quite good as long as it's not mounted to the wall. When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table. When the tv is on a tv stand one foot from the wall it has great, clear very loud sound that is more than adequate for my use. That being said a external subwoofer and/or sound bar would be advisable for anyone who likes a lot of extra ""BASS""

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)

But let's start at the beginning. This is a very nice Energizer headset that could have been a lot better except for American corporate insistence on not quite getting things as well as they might have.  They list their light at 150 lumens, which is respectable and serviceable, but certainly not one of the  brightest headsets on the markets. They claim to have made a technological adjustment that makes this four times brighter. But they aren't clear about this. If this is four times brighter, that would mean it is a 600 lumens. If it is 600 lumens, then why not say it? I suspect because it really is just a 150 lumens headset, but they want you to think it is rather more. Regardless, this bright enough for most lighting needs. Where it fails is the headband. I have a couple of other headlamps, and in both instances they constructed the headset with several pieces of elastic. This allows for a couple of things. It provides a more stable perch on the head, which it most certainly provides. It also provides a more comfortable perch for the headlamp. This is simply not a very comfortable headset to wear. The lone band really cuts into your skin when holding it. If you tried to wear this on your head  for any length of time you would begin to experience discomfort and most probably a pressure headache.

This is not a bad headlamp, but there are much better ones available for just about any need.

At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump.

Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.

I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?

But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.

To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.

In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not.",Not churned

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.",Not churned

I am no professional. I had used a basic DSLR prior to this the k2000. So this review is based on someone upgrading from a beginner SLR to a more sophisticated one.

Pros:

Low light: This is a camera that takes great low light pictures, you can push the ISO up pretty high and still get great pictures. This was the biggest reason for me to upgrade. I had a hard time taking pictures of my kids in various performances with terrible lighting conditions. Obviously one needs a good lens. But with my old camera I had to throw too many away. This camera combined with the DA 50-135mm lens is one terrific package for such situations.

Weight/Size: this is the most compact camera at such a level that you will find.

Weather resistant: This is a weather resistant camera! Combine this with a weather resistant lens and you are all set.

Electronic Level: I thought this was a gimmick but after using it for a few days, I find it indispensable to take level photos.

User Selectable Focus points: these are standard in expensive cameras, nothing special if you have used such cameras before but for somone upgrading I quickly found out how convenient this was.

Shake reduction: Pentax unlike Nikon/Canon has shake reduction built into the camera, so any lens you put on it has shake reduction function.

Lenses: Pentax has small pancake lenses called limited lenses. Try these if you are new to Pentax. They are superb and great to walk around with without looking like a dork.

Cons: Expensive...",Not churned

When you want to use it you simply reach under the work surface, push up on the bolt, slide the clamp onto the bolt head and clamp down your piece.

The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:

- There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.

- It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.

I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!

In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand.",Not churned

The X-Mini Happy was $28 more (at the time)
and also came with a 2GB SD Card (mini with adapter)
plus Earphones (Plug Type).

Both came with a Pull String Carry Sack.

I loaded 2 SD cards with the same MP3s,
synchronized the start as best as possible,
and compared the sound of each using the respective Mute Buttons.

No Doubt About It: the X-Mini Happy had a Better Sound.

The SD Mini sounded OK until it was being compared to the X-Mini Happy.

The X-Mini Happy seemed to have a Fuller Sound -
Particularly with the Classical Music
(Amazon's: 99 Most Essential Masterpieces of the Classical Era).

But if you don't want to spend the Extra Bucks for the X-Mini Happy,
you won't be Sad with the SD Mini.

Also, the Earphones included with the Happy are OK,
but when compared with the
""Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers"",
they were Sadly, Quite Inferior.
But this might have been an Unfair Comparison.",Apr

The only way to fix it is to just throw the one in a bag.  The plastic part needs to be re-attached to the lens cap to make it fit.  The camera will only use one lens at a time.

I haven't used it with a Nikkor, but I do like it a lot.  I wish I could buy a lens cap for it, but I don't think I'll have to do that.

The other issue I have with it is that it doesn't fit the lens hood.  The hood is a good thing, because it's kind of stiff.  I wish I had found one that was a bit bigger.

Overall, this camera is a good value and I'd recommend it to anyone.  I'd probably buy another if I could.

I don't recommend this camera to anyone unless you already own a camera.  I don't know if you'll be getting this camera for free, but if you do, it's worth the money.I love it!Great sound.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

Lenox, Milwaukee, Husky, Kobalt, Irwin etc. This is the best one. One little mod I like to do is take the shaft and bits from the Kline 11 in 1 and put it in the beefier bigger handle of this 10 in 1 to get that extra bit. I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.

Mine has held up for the last 3 years and the handle, bits show minimal wear. They see moderate to heavy use (no abuse) every day.",Not churned

I'm on an Android phone and the app is missing the ability to view the camera remotely. You can't simply use the Skybell app to see if everything is OK at the door.  The motion detection doesn't work, and you have to press the door bell before it'll send you an alert.  This was supposed to be working when they shipped.  I emailed them directly to check before ordering.

The Android app is crashing when you try to configure some things.  Android tablets are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile devices inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device. This is limiting as you always have to have your phone near you.  Hope they fix this soon.

I had my WiFi access point configured for N-Only as I do not have older 802.11b/g devices.  It never connected to the 2.4Ghz N-Only radio.  I had to go back into the WiFi AP and reconfigure to support the older 802.11b/g devices.  It says it's N compatible, but looks like it may not be.  This delayed the install procedure as I tried 5 times to get the device connected to the WiFi before taking a look at the WiFi AP settings.  So if you're having problems connecting it to your WiFi, double check this setting.

I think the concept is a really great idea and hopefully these items are simply version 1.0 growing pains.  Wait a few months for the product to mature.  If they can get the rest of the features in and fix the app bugs, it'll be a cool product.",Feb

First Impressions-- Looks good out the box.  Feels solid and has good quality construction feel.  Seems like a good high quality product.

Closer Inspection and usage-  Great multi function emergency light.  This thing is awesome and has some many uses.  It uses 3 AAA batteries which are not included.  3 modes of operation -- normal flashlight, flashing side lights and a red strobe light which can be used as a emergency flare.  Not too big and fits great in the hand.  Good device to function as a simple flashlight or an emergency safety device when needed.

PROS:
---Excellent, excellent Price (well worth the money)
---Good solid quality construction body
---Bright and easy to see
---3 modes
---Hands - free operation
---Can be used as an emergency roadside flare

I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.

The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years.

The physical Harmony Home remote is fantastic. I love the simple design, love the fact that you can program buttons to do two different things depending on if you long press or short press. Love that it's RF. If Logitech threw an LCD and backlight on this thing, it would be the best remote they've ever created.

Where the problems begin is there's no LCD on the remote. Your smartphone is supposed to take on that task and unfortunately, the app that makes this possible just sucks. Sometimes it's slow to connect to the hub, sometimes it crashes, sometimes the hub just stops responding to it. More often than not, I would grab the OEM remotes because it was so much faster and less frustrating. That's not a good sign.

I actually managed to put up with the app for a while, but the thing that had me running back to my Harmony One was when something gets out of sync (happens more than you think), there's no ""help"" button on the remote. I had to dig my phone out, unlock it, launch the app, wait for it to find the hub, hope the app doesn't crash, then fix the sync problem. This would take me 2 seconds to fix with my old Harmony One. With Harmony Home, it takes a good minute.

I don't like the direction Logitech is going with the smartphone thing. They need to focus on making good physical remotes. Does anyone really enjoy using their smartphone as remote? It's clumsy and takes too long to do anything with. I cringed every time I needed to launch the Harmony app to do something. I need tactile buttons Logitech!",Oct

I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money.",Not churned

Most people will find the light a bit harsh and the range of color temperatures a bit arbitrary. People who like to fiddle with stuff will enjoy this lamp. Let me list the pros and cons.

Pros:
The lamp is lightweight and seems pretty sturdy and stable on the base.
The light is very steady and there is no flicker.
The controls are easy to learn and access.
The finish is nice.
The lamp head is long enough for most desktop applications.
The lamp head can be pivoted and tilted to a wide range of angles.
The head can be pointed backward to bounce the light off the wall for an indirect lighting effect.

Cons:
The lamp head can only be rotated 45 degrees left and right on the base.
The two middle color temperatures are quite similar and the whitest temperature is very harsh and almost bluish.
The lamp uses a power block instead of a direct plug in.
The styling of the lamp probably won't fit with most desk styles. It is sort of  nouveu but also sort of sharp angled.

I will be using the lamp for some photographic work and it is very good for setting white balance and exposure for close ups. My camera can really tell the difference in the colors, and the range of dimming is very wide. I am not sure whether the lamp has any eye protecting value as stated, or not.

It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks.
CONS:
1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly.
2. Runs very hot and noisy.
3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily.
TIPS:
1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time.
2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.  If you use the button that's built-in to the main tool, you'll strip the gears in the right-angle attachment.",May

Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).",Not churned

It has been two years and the switch is still working great.

Update:
I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.
By the way don't bother calling the ""technical service number"", they can only tell you to send the product into their warranty center.  Write them an email at info@leviton.com

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow.",Jul

I was using a different laptop cooling fan solution before this, but it was noisy and barely helping unless it was on high (extra loud mode).

When I ordered this, I was expecting better cooling from a larger fan, but the other MAJOR benefit to a large fan, and the main reason I bought this item, is that it's almost silent. Smaller fans spin faster and therefore make more noise.

This fan is almost as big as the 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand itself, leaves about 1"" around each side. You can use it with or without the stand. When sitting flat, it has a very clean and simple profile.

Finally, I love the bamboo - it was a final selling point for me.

BTW, they sell a ""pro"" version of this, with a nifty adjustable stand. I would have bought that, but it has two small fans, so it would be noisier than this one. I use this sitting flat with the lid closed and plugged into one monitor, so adjusting the angle is a moot point.",Not churned

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work. Normally either a KVM or switching inputs would solve this except my gsync monitor only has one input and a KVM limits the frame rate and breaks gsync so that's not a solution for me where this is.

I've used a few different KM switches and they are all problematic, this is the most seamless solution I've found yet.",Aug

This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did.

If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.

After retightened I decided to check oil on the stick after reading reviews about oil being at lowest line from factory. I tilted it up on end and put 7mm hex in nut and will not move. I mean will not turn loose. So I called 800 number. Got a very pleasant gentlemen on phone that told me that's because they use thread lock so it will not leak in transit. He said you have to give the hex wrench a hard tap to break the glue or use a lock creasant  wrench (vise-grips) to lock on the round end of hex dip stick and give that a tap to loosen. This is not in the manual. Word of advise: Do not strip your 7mm hex nut, use the lock wrench and tap it and behold it is loose. Then screw it out with hex wrench that is included. I found the hydrologic oil to still be between the lines. Then I spent about 3 hours splitting about half a cord of wood. it went through my hard sweet gum ball wood like butter( if you get it with the grain). Stacked it and covered it and done. Also use some kind of silicone spray on the black and red back and forth stuff. Oil will cause wood chips to stick to it. And it helps to prevent screeching sounds.

(The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.

My friend bought a Canon G-7 to replace the Sony (We have the Same Sony Camera). We both got in to the hype of all the reviews. We both tested the canon cameras quite a bit. Both Canon(s) has more options then the Sony does. But the Sony overall picture is much sharper and the colors are more realistic and natural. I kept my Canon just cause I was in so deep, I had already received a 8 gig SDHC Card, had a rebate on the Epson Printer so I ended up keeping the Canon and sold the Sony. It was a hard choice, knowing the sony picture quality is that much better. My friend on the other hand is selling his New Canon G-7, ""too bulky and its not worth it to lug it around when the Sony P-200 takes better sharper pics."" I agree, the Sony picture quality is better then the Canon 850IS. I can affirm that! The only thing is the Sony takes average low light pics, but the Canon 850is is no world beater in that department either. When it comes to day light shots, the Sony wins hands down over the 850is and also according to my friend the sony beats the Canon G-7 in outdoor photos ""not zoomed"". Like I said the Canon(s) has more options, and some might counter that you need to manaual play with the canon to get a better pic. But really who wants to mess with manual settings on a trip overseas? How many pics will you miss? The Sony P-200 has as fast boot up as the Canon 850IS and takes pics much much faster with the flash when it comes to multiple pics. And the sony flat out takes better pics. No doubt the canon is a excellent camera, but its questionable as to how good compared with a sony that came out in 2005...the Sony has less options, but has great image quality and ""sony Style"".",Jul

I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.
The Garmin application the charts run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types.  I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit.
The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of charts from the CD-ROM.

This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value.

But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.",Not churned

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above.",Aug

I have purchased over a dozen small solar powered outdoor lights in the last few years. Whats not to like in a light that powers up from the sun and helps you see things at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It gets full sun most of the day and it lasts an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered events the light ran all night.

All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen models of lights from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hours on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and runs about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line posts on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard.

Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer.

I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.",Not churned

Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.

The switch has a self-healing mechanism. The ""healing"" is not a great feature, but it's a great feature.

I was thinking about changing the battery to a lithium-ion battery, but I ended up going with a non-dimmable version of this switch.

So I had to install a different switch to replace the one with a non-dimmable one.

The other switch I used was a lithium-ion version, which is still a great feature, but it's more expensive than the one I replaced.

I replaced the battery with a non-dimmable one.

So I can't comment on how it will perform, but it's certainly a nice feature.

The lights are bright and well built. They're very well made and have a very good feel.

Rigs are priced way too high and it's often hard to find a rig at an affordable price. Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.

Now you really don't need a ton of instructions if you know in general what you are doing. But seriously, no instructions on their website? What is this 1998?
As far as the product it looks good when you are done, but there are some issues.
-The returns fit inside the rails and they recommend using silicone to glue them in place. They sit pretty far out from the wall which sort of defeats the purpose. ( they are to keep from people catching clothing or other things over the railing and that causing a fall) the returns stood out I would say 3/4 of an inch. (I should have measured but did not)
-They are hard to get to fit nice and tight against the pipe. This goes about 2x for the knuckle joint if you use that I used wide masking tape to hold them in place.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels.

Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.

This is just as it appears to be in the photo & stats.
Mora is synonymous with ""consistently great affordable knives"" and this one in particular is no exception.
Because of it's narrow, short blade, and high Scandinavian grind, this basic wood carving knife is perfect for carving.
One of the reasons most wood carving blades are short is for control of the blade, enabling the holder to make precision cuts, and requiring the user to take their time with small cuts, rather than large sweeping ones.
In all other ways, this is a standard Mora knife.",Not churned

Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries.",Feb

It's like the extinguishers you used to see in schools.  I think few government buildings keep them around anymore, having gone to dry chemical extinguishers as codes become more and more restrictive.  I do have typical ABC extinguishers in my garage and kitchen, but I bought this to have upstairs to fight my way to my kids' rooms in that fire that wakes you up in the middle of the night--you know, then one where  you hear the smoke detector going off and open your bedroom door to find your hallway walls and carpet completely involved.  I have no doubt this will work great for that.  I don't plan on having to extinguish any grease or chemical fires in the upstairs portion of my home.  Note that it requires a 100 psi compressor to charge (or a really good manual pump).  I opted to use my little compressor which coincidentally kicks off at 100 psi.  When re-attempting to get that last few psi in there, it did spit a little water back into the air hose, which is not ideal.  I recommend either using a sturdy hand pump or a compressor which is regulated to something well above 100 psi.

But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.

This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.

I want to note that the vendor I bought from (they sell through Amazon, so this is appropriate to mention), The Best Things, is a good company and I would not hesitate to give them my business.  But I cannot recommend the Nobex saw.",Jun

Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.

I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.

Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.

My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.

For me at 7-bucks they're thrown in the drawer and my iHome pen is clipped in my Venue Pro case.  They're built well but just don't work great on any of the 4 tablet devices I have, eh?  Get 'em if you've tried a friends on your device and they work. For me, not so much and if I require another stylus it'll be a 2nd iHome pen/stylus.

I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps.

Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable.",Not churned

This is more than an average light changing lamp. A small disc over the 12 LED lights moves while projecting the light through the 5 1/4 inch rippled lens, creating wonderful, ever-changing waves across the ceiling, wall or any surface it is aimed towards.
The patterns and colors are mesmerizing! The push of a button takes you to the next color. There are 8 different color patterns taking you from a multi pattern to red, to blue to green. Pick one that fits you mood.
This lighted orb also contains a speaker and an input to plug in your mp3 player, computer, your phone, etc so you can enjoy your music at the same time.
The projector can be operated off a wall outlet via the included outlet adapter or it can be operated off a USB device. You can take this almost anywhere to enjoy the hypnotic waves of color. It automatically turns off after an hour. I do wish there was a switch to deactivate the auto off for times when you want it to stay on longer. It's not that big of a deal to push the button to turn it back on though.
I love just turning off the light and having this cast waves over the ceiling and walls while watching TV or working on the computer. It gives me a tranquil feeling that calms me and lets my mind relax a little.

Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

Update 4/17/2013

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.

 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.

I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to.

It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.

The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want. Other reviewers say the switch goes bad after a while and causes the light to flicker, but apparently it can be replaced rather easily if that happens (I hope IKEA reads those reviews and works on a better switch, as it seems to be the only down side - for some - for this very nice product).",Not churned

We all would occasionally find ourselves with the need for a knife or wrench or screwdriver, but the campus where we work is a ""no weapons allowed"" kind of place, so even a Swiss Army type knife might ruffle some feathers. Taking this little thing out doesn't raise anyone's eyebrows at all, and while it's not as effective as a Leatherman or something along those lines, it's still darned handy to have for popping open boxes, prying open stuff, and so on. Shipping took quite a long time - about a month - but considering that it's coming straight from China and you're only paying ONE DOLLAR apiece for these things, it's kinda hard to really gripe much.

Only complaint: The little page of instructions that tells what is what on this tool are entirely in Chinese. No English instructions whatsoever, so you've gotta guess what does what on this thing. I Googled it and there are some pics with numbers over each spot that list the function of each thing on this. Primarily, the handiest parts are the chisel-ground ""knife"" edge, the flat screwdriver corner, the ""saw"" section, and the bottle opener, in that order.

Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic).",Jun

Also the hinge of the case is a living hinge, meaning the hinge is just really bending plastic back and forth, without a hinge like a door hinge so to speak it really makes the case very suspect-able to wearing out as you bend the plastic to open the case and then have to bend the plastic back to the closing position. The sockets are great, the customer service associated with the TEXTON tool brand is excellent, but the case itself could have better design for longevity and sockets keeping where they should stay as you move the case with the door in the open position.

Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo). It is fairly light given it's size and doesn't add as much bulk as one might think to your iPad Pro. All in all, this is another fantastic case/cover from UAG.

The only tip I should pass along is that the you install a new one, do instal the hose and point the hose at the drain, as close as you can get to the drain) then slowly turn up the water. The first few seconds that the water is running it will throw out some carbon from this filter. The carbon is, of course, completely harmless but its particles are so small that will get trapped in the texture of your shower floor and leave a black mark. It eventually goes away but it might be noticeable to some people.

The other tip I can offer is that this is an effective filter but it clogs up easily. There are only two of us that use the one in the master bath and it only lasts 4 months (once it lasted 5 months, I got al excited but the next one only lasted 5 months again).

If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.
